            <h2>NASA TLX Questionnaires</h2>
            <p>The NASA Task Load Index (TLX) questionnaires are designed to measure subjective workload across six dimensions. These questionnaires are essential tools for researchers and professionals aiming to assess and optimize human performance in various tasks.</p>

            <h3>Dimensions Assessed by NASA TLX</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Mental Demand:</strong> How much mental and perceptual activity was required?</li>
                <li><strong>Physical Demand:</strong> How much physical activity was required?</li>
                <li><strong>Temporal Demand:</strong> How much time pressure did you feel?</li>
                <li><strong>Performance:</strong> How successful were you in accomplishing the task?</li>
                <li><strong>Effort:</strong> How hard did you have to work to accomplish your level of performance?</li>
                <li><strong>Frustration:</strong> How insecure, discouraged, irritated, stressed, and annoyed were you?</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Components of the NASA TLX Questionnaires</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Rating Scale Questionnaire</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Participants rate each dimension on a scale from 0 (very low) to 100 (very high).</li>
                        <li>This questionnaire helps to gather subjective assessments of the workload experienced during a task.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Pairwise Comparison Questionnaire</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Participants compare each pair of the six dimensions to determine which dimension is more relevant to the workload for the task.</li>
                        <li>This helps in weighting the importance of each dimension in calculating the overall workload score.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>How to Administer the NASA TLX Questionnaires</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Preparation</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Select the task or set of tasks you want to evaluate.</li>
                        <li>Ensure participants understand the purpose of the assessment and the meaning of each dimension.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Rating Scale</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Provide the Rating Scale Questionnaire to the participants after they complete the task.</li>
                        <li>Ask participants to rate each of the six dimensions based on their experience during the task.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Pairwise Comparison</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Provide the Pairwise Comparison Questionnaire.</li>
                        <li>Participants compare each pair of dimensions (e.g., Mental Demand vs. Physical Demand) to determine which one had a greater impact on their workload.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Data Collection</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Collect the completed questionnaires from all participants.</li>
                        <li>Ensure all ratings and comparisons are recorded accurately.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Data Analysis</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Use the ratings and pairwise comparisons to calculate the weighted workload score.</li>
                        <li>Analyze the data to identify areas of high workload and potential improvements.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ol>
